What is LIRI Bot?

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI, however, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface.

How does it works?
 LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and returns the relative data using some API. It can be:
 node liri spotify-this "song name".
